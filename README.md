# Doppler Radar

Radar is a tool for detecting and identifying API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive secrets stored in your codebase. It is language agnostic and helps prevent API token leakage and other security misconfigurations. Radar is an important part of an application's security pipeline and can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to detect secrets before they're merged upstream.

## Installation

`npm install -g @dopplerhq/radar`

## CLI usage

Scan a git repo: `radar --repo REPO_URL [--branch BRANCH]`

Scan a local file/directory: `radar --path PATH`

You can see a full list of configuration options by running `radar --help`

### Library usage

Scan a local file/directory:

```
const radar = require("@dopplerhq/radar");
const results = new radar().scan(PATH);
```

## Why it matters
API token leakage is rampant. In a high profile study, North Carolina State University identified over 200,000 secrets across 100,000 public GitHub repositories. These secrets were sitting on the public internet and available to any adversary. With these secrets, anyone could have accessed confidential (and possibly even legally protected) data. Static secrets also tend to indicate the use of that same secret across all environments, breaking another security best practice. Security is hardâ„¢, but a few small steps can go a long way towards increasing your organization's security posture.

## How it works

Radar uses filters to calculate the likelihood that a string is a stored secret. This includes things like the string's entropy, the inclusion of dictionary words, and more. A list of identified secrets is returned so that action may be taken.

Radar's model is a bit different than other tools. These tools typically employ a set of regex patterns to identify tokens from common service providers. This is highly reliable for supported services, but has the obvious shortcomings of a) supporting a limited number of services and b) not supporting other types of static secrets. The filter approach that Radar employs casts a wider net, which can result in false positives. Radar has the explicit goal of minimizing these false positives to avoid generating useless noise. We tend to find that when a security tool is overly noisy, humans begin to ignore all of its output.
